# Flopping Mode EDSR

This project was written with qopt version 1.3.4.

This folder contains a model for a single electron manipulated in a double
quantum dot. The model was used to study flopping-mode EDSR in the weak and 
strong driving regime as described in the article: coming soon. 


## Setup File

The setup file contains the central core code of the model and a series of 
convenience functions to create instances of qopt classes.

## Example Jupyter Notebooks

The example notebooks show some parts of the implemented functionality. There 
is one extensive notebook for the spin-orbit model and a shorter notebook
on the full spin-orbit-valley model. The notebooks demonstrate how the code can 
be used to create the pulse shapes, plot the energy spectrum, simulate the 
pulse and optimize it.
