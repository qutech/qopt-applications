# Cryo-Electronics

This package was written with qopt 1.3.5.

In this project, I present algorithms for discrete pulse optimization. The 
goal of this Project was to determine the required pulse resolution for 
noise resilient EDSR pulses applied to Loss-DiVincenzo qubits.

## Setup

The model is implemented in the file cryoel_model.py and utility functions
can be found in the file cryoel_util.py.

## Execution and Analysis

The execution notebook start the parallelized optimization of control pulses
and the analysis notebook processes and plots the results.

The pulse_plot notebook plots an example pulse for visualization.
